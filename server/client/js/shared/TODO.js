Jagex HQ Visit: IRL Video
This video covers the IRL highlights of my visit to the Jagex Game Studios in the UK and features Alkan, Chris Archie, James, Simon, A Frie(nd), Rogie, Omar, Sam, Munclesonkey, Rainy, Jake, Joking, KKComics, Gizzy, Cavemanfilms, Mexk, iAm_Naveed and many JMods.


hey its idk and this video will be about the irl part of my trip to jagex hq

okay so it all started with a 6 hours long night flight in which i tried to sleep with little success

when i arrive, i visited the studios and we tested the legacy mode on the jagex computers
we also talked about what was good, what was bad and so on but i couldnt record that

after that, we went do some bowling!
lots of fun
alkan managed to slide and fall on his back on his first throw,
right  there you can see a friend, and fun fact, because his name was too long, he was named a frie

so now you can see my epic bowling skills
i failed the first throw but it was intentional ofc
second throw was a bit better

after, we went to an italian restaurant
i already have some problem with english cooking terms but serisouly, i couldnt understand half the menu
the food was really good tho


once we were done, i finally went to the appartement, it was really big
so i was in same appartment than chris archie and alkan
and if youre wondering, right there alkan is saying that im the most epic guy on earth
so yeah, heres where i slept.
i stayed up for over 30 hours without sleeping on the first day

the next day we tested the legacy mode even more and i livestreamed killing vorago and getting trim comp cape


there was also some kind of dance, 
so yeah, overall, it was really good trip, i had lots of fun with the other runescape players
and jagex, you can invite me again whenver you want.
so this was the irl part of my trip, you can click the annotation on the screen to check my interview with mod mmg, my interview with the legacy team
and my video about the legacy mode from a skiller point of view.

thanksa gain for watching and cya.
