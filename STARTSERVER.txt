Most antivirus blocks .bat and .exe files. If you can't use STARTSERVER.bat, here's another way to run the server:
-To make it easier, move the game engine folder (rainingchain) in an easily reachable folder. (Ex: C:Users\YOURNAME\rainingchain) (Recommended for beginners) 
-Open command prompt. (Search for command with window start search bar)
-Move to the rainingchain directory using the command "cd.." (to exit folder) and "cd [folder_name]" (to enter folder)
-Once inside the rainingchain folder, type "node app.js" in the command line.
